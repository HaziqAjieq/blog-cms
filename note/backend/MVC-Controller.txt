What is MVC?
  -Model - handles data and business logic (Post,User,Tag)
  -View - handles what the user sees(HTML,BLade,React);
  -Controller - handles incoming request and sends the correct data to views or ationships

in Laravel:

  -Model live in app/Models
  -Controller live in app/Https/Controllers
  -Views usually llive in resources/view(Blade) or are separated if using React.

What is laravel Controller?

  A controller is a PHP class that handles request (from browser,frontend apps,API client).

Example:

    Route::get('/posts',[PostController::class, 'index']);

    that tells laravel:
      when someone visits /post, use the index() method from PostController.



How Laravel works with React (as a Frontend)
if im using REact as the frontend (instead of Blade views), here's how things connect

layer:
  1.Model
    -Laravel role
      -Eloquent model(e.g Post)

    -React role
      -Fetch data via API

  2.Controller
    -Laravel role 
      -Accepts request from react,retusn JSON

    -React role
      -Send fetch/axios request to Laravel

  3.View
    -Laravel role
      -	❌ Blade not used(inthis case)
    
    -React role
      -React handles all UI rendering


Example React-to-laravel

1.React sends a request:

  fetch('/api/posts')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));

2.Laravel Controller respondsL

  public function index()
  {
    return Post::all(); //returns JSON automatically
  }

3.React display the data in a component.

Commond Controller Methods (CURD)

Methods:
  1.Index()
   - GET/posts
    List all posts

  2.Store()
    - POST/posts
    Create a post
  
  3.show()
    - GET/posts/{id}
    Show one post

  4.update()
    - PUT/posts/{id}
    Update post

  5.destroy()
    - Delete/posts/{id}
    Delete post

React will call these endpoints using fetch() or axios.

Summary Notes

-Laravel controller = logic center for HTTP request.
-It handles validation,databse access, and returns JSON (for React).
-React replaces the BLade view - it consumes Laravel's API responses.
-Together they form a decoupled MVC
