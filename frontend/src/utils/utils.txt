purpose for this folder is a folder or module serve as a designated location for storing small,reusabel helper functions and common code that can be used across various components and modules.

Purpose and benefits:
1.Code Reusability:
  -utility functions encapsulate common logic,preventing code duplication and promoting a DRY(dont repe4at yoursels approach.)

2.Modularity and organization:
  -Grouping related helper functions in a dediacted 'utils' locations improves code organization and makes it easier to find and manage shared functionalities.

3.Readability and maintainability:
  -By extracting complex or repeatitive logic into separate utility funcitons,components become cleaner,more focused, and easier to understand and maintain.

4.Testability:
  -Pure utility functions,which dont rely on external state or side effects,are inherently easier to test in isolation.


  ðŸ’¡ When to Create a New Utility
        DRY Principle: When you use the same logic in 3+ places

        Complex Logic: Code that's hard to read inline

        External Dependencies: Isolate libraries like date-fns

        Project-Specific Rules: Like your rating system
